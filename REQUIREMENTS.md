## Requirements

- Implement a Rest API with CRUD functionality. 
- Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- Unit test as much as you can.
- Set up service with docker compse.

**Nice to have**:
- Secure the API with your choice of authentication mechanism.

**Notes**:  
**Please refrain from releasing your code to public so that everyone has equal opportunities.**

#### 3. Think about PUT and DELETE by yourself

## What we are looking for

Pay close attention to the structure and the dependency between packages of your application. This determines how testable your code is. It also allows you to create an API structure that is highly composable, modular and easy to read.

On the whole, we care about attention to detail, the idiomatic use of Go, and an understanding of what an API's role is.

Happy Coding!
